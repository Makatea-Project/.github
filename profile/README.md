# Introduction

The Makatea Project aims to build a
[QubesOS](https://www.qubes-os.org/)-inspired operating system for servers
running atop the [seL4](https://sel4.systems/) formally verified microkernel.
This is a work-in-progress and not intended for use yet. Current efforts are
focused on the fundamental building blocks: the seL4 microkernel, the sel4cp
framework, and the x86 VMM.

This project is led by [Neutrality](https://neutrality.ch/) with contributions
from the [Trustworthy Systems Group](https://trustworthy.systems/projects/TS/makatea)
at the [University of New South Wales](https://www.unsw.edu.au/).
